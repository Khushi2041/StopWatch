# StopWatch
A fully responsive professional stopwatch using HTML, CSS, Jquey and Bootstrap. Whenever the page is load, two buttons will appear- Start button and Lap button. So if you click on the start button, you will see the two counters counting, the time counter and the lap counter. If we click on the stop button both the counters will stop and we can resume it by clicking on the resuming button or can restart it by clicking on the restart button. Now if we click on the lap button, the lap time counter will restart from zero and we are going to retrieve information about the previous lap.
